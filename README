Perform analysis of (selected) JSF 1.1 JSP files and validate that
all EL expressions reference only existing managed beans and their
properties/action methods.

USAGE
See the main class net.jakubholy.jeeutils.jsfelcheck.JsfStaticAnalyzer
and perhaps try to run it from the command line (it prints usage info).

MORE INFO

<p>
For local variables, such as the <var>var</var> produced by h:dataTable, you must first declare of
what type they are as this cannot be determined based on the code, see {@link JsfElValidator#definePropertyTypeOverride(String, Class)}.
<p>
If there are some EL variables aside of managed beans in faces-config and the local ones you can
declare them to the validator via {@link JsfElValidator#declareVariable(String, Object)}.
<p>
If there are other tags than h:dataTable that can create local variables, you must create and
register an appropriate resolver for them as is done with the dataTable.

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<pre>
- JSF 1.1 (switching to another one requires replacing the Sun's ValueBindingFactory and
MethodBindingFactory used by the {@link JsfElValidator} by appropriate alternatives).
- Currently it's assumed that a tag can declare only 1 local variable (var in dataTable).
- Included files (statically or dynamically) are processed without taking their inclusion
into account, i.e. variables defined in the including page aren't available when checking them.
We have though all the information for taking inclusions into account available, it would just
require more work (filter the included files out not to be processed as top-level files and
when an inclusion tag is encountered, process the included file passing the current context on;
see {@link org.apache.jasper.compiler.JsfElCheckingVisitor} and
org.apache.jasper.compiler.Node.Visitor.visit(IncludeAction)
, org.apache.jasper.compiler.Node.Visitor.visit(IncludeDirective)).

TODO
- add example JSF page
- better error msg for
    '#{bookingHandler.lccBookingObj.lccAirLowFareIn.fares[0].presAmount}': PropertyNotFoundException - Property 'presAmount' not found on class net.jakubholy.jeeutils.jsfelcheck.validator.MockObjectOfUnknownType]; expression=#{bookingHandler.lccBookingObj.lccAirLowFareIn.fares[0].presAmount}, file=/lccbookingdetails.jsp, tagLine=126]
 => make it clear the solution is st. like
 propertyTypeOverrides.put("bookingHandler.lccBookingObj.lccAirLowFareIn.fares.*",  Fare.class);

- reorganize packages
- publish to Maven central

...
- Perform a separate run using the RegExp EL extractor to verify that the Jasper-based one
has found all EL expressions.

DEVELOPEMET

Key classes
- JsfStaticAnalyzer - the main method, wires all together
- JsfElValidatingPageNodeListener - drives the validation based on JSP tags being processed
    and composes the failures/successes report
- ValidatingJsfElResolver - actual checks of JSF EL expressions

---
- net.jakubholy.jeeutils.jsfelcheck.expressionfinder.impl.jasper.PageNodeExpressionValidator.isMethodBinding(String) - distinguish value and method binding
